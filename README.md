A fully responsive mock photography website. The front page alternates through an array of pictures and outputs them to the screen with 
Javascript. I've made good use of CSS Flexbox , and incorporated CSS's Grid system on the Work page. It also features multiple transitions,
and transformations. The social media buttons are from Font Awesome, although I might change them to SVG buttons in the future.
